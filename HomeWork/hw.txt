user interface:
01.user interface "feels weird":
02. arrow down doesn't really open a list like it should, but it refreshes the list (kind of);
03.In small script under the table it there is text "Double click to edit a toodo" but it doesn't work:
on html we can see that its only <p></p> and have no script. 
04.On a small screen Text "To do list" overlaps.
05. It says number of how many items left on a list, but it's inaccurate, its always one number less. and when you complete all the items on a list its says "-1 item left" on a list.
06. If you double click on a downward arrow it crosses all the items on a list at once. Instead of closing the list.
